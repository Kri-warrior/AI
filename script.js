    "explain the order of operations in mathematics.":"The order of operations, often abbreviated as PEMDAS, is a set of rules used in mathematics to determine the sequence in which calculations are performed when evaluating an expression that contains multiple operations. Following the order of operations ensures that everyone arrives at the same correct result when solving mathematical expressions. PEMDAS stands for:1. **P** - Parentheses: Perform calculations inside parentheses first. Start with the innermost parentheses and work your way out. 2. **E** - Exponents: Next, calculate any exponentiation (raising a number to a power). This includes operations like squaring (raising to the power of 2) or cubing (raising to the power of 3).3. **M** and **D** - Multiplication and Division: Perform multiplication and division from left to right. These operations have the same level of precedence, so they are done in the order they appear in the expression. 4. **A** and **S** - Addition and Subtraction: Finally, perform addition and subtraction from left to right. Like multiplication and division, these operations are done in the order they appear in the expression.Remembering PEMDAS helps avoid ambiguity in mathematical expressions and ensures that calculations are done consistently. If an expression doesn't contain parentheses or exponents, you simply work from left to right, performing multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.",
